# Description

This repository is for my final project in TRGN 510. 
My goal is to find out whether ER positive is a distinct subclass of breast cancer from the global analysis of DNA expression(RNA- Seq data).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

To make TCGA-BRCA_PCA.R (click [here](https://github.com/jingqian05/trgn510-Finalproject/blob/master/TCGA-BRCA_PCA.R) to see the code) and index.Rmd (click [here](https://github.com/jingqian05/trgn510-Finalproject/blob/master/index.Rmd)) to run, first install Rstudio. And then import the following 5 files into it. These samples are from [NCIâ€™s Genomic Data Commons](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov). All of them are breast cancer RNA-seq in HTSeq-FPKM.

## Running the tests
Open TCGA-BRCA_PCA.R in Rstudio and run it.
Open index.Rmd in Rstudio and run the document.


## Analysis

By running the code, it will generate PCA plots and stats of my data.
