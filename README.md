# Description
This repository is for my final project in TRGN 510. To make TCGA-BRCA_PCA.R (click [here](https://github.com/jingqian05/trgn510-Finalproject/blob/master/TCGA-BRCA_PCA.R) to see the code) possibel to run, first import 5 .txt files into RStudio and then run the script. It will generate PCA plots and stats of my data. 

# Datasets
First I downloade my 40 samples from [NCIâ€™s Genomic Data Commons](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov). All of them are breast cancer RNA-seq in HTSeq-FPKM.

# My Goal
My goal is to find out whether ER positive is a distinct subclass of breast cancer from the global analysis of DNA expression(RNA- Seq data).

# Proposed Analysis
The data points are colored by their different race group, such as Asians and African Americans.
